<Description of what you have accomplished>
Finish all steps of simulating a jello cube, including acceleration function, collision detection, bounce off effect, force field, store pictures and animation.
The code are well-commented, and I also provide the animation and pic folder to present my work. All codes are stored in this zip file.

<Also, explain any extra credit that you have implemented.

<Animation demonstrate all bonus points. It used "rotate.w".>
1. Inclined plane: Implement collision detection and bounce off effect by using the parameters given in the world file. The jello works well in this situation.

2. Allow user to select one of six surfaces by clicking keyboard '0' - '5'. '6' to deactivate this function. The selected surface is high-lighted. User can easily find the surface which they choose. Then they can click left mouse button and release it. The code will calculate the mouse movement, transfer it to extern force and apply it to the selected surface.

3. The cube is textured by dice pictures. User can use keyboard 't' to apply texture or remove this action.
